<h1>Floating Navigation Development Test</h1>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>I was instructed to create a floating navigation to the right side using the fundamental skills
of HTML, CSS, and Javascript(JQuery)</p>
<h3>CSS explained</h3>
<p>I started with the intial HTML structure and building out a basic navigation consisting of: Home, About, and Contact links
<br>
To increase the page length and ensure that scrolling is functional I added multiple lines of Lorem lipsum
</p>

<h3>CSS explained</h3>
<p>
I began inputting css and broke it down into 3 categories:
<br>
Main<br>
To provide the document with its core element such as fonts, padding, margin, background-color, and any other additional elements. In an event this were a multi page layout my nav styling would go here as well to provide consistency and efficency through multiple pages.<br>
Media Queries<br>
As the Name states it is my css styling for different media devices, to simplify the change, I changed the font size and background color to ensure functionality.<br>
Index<br>
This file is to show all the styling I added to each element with some transition effect and some transparency in the nav elemnt and hover effects
</p>

<h3>Javascript(Jquery) explained</h3>
<p>Checks if the current window width is less than or equal to 450px, If condition is true nav will be hidden</p>
<p>The scroll function will be triggered upon scrolling in the window. If you scroll down more than 50px the navigation will fade in and vice versa, if scrolling back up at 300</p>

<h2>Additional Info</h2>
<p> The navigation may look like it is originally on display so be sure to refresh page or slightly scroll down and it will correct itself</p>
